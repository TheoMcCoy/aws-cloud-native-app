# Exercise 3 ‚Äì AWS Cloud Native App (Terraform)

This project provisions a **cloud-native application** on AWS using Terraform only.  
It creates a secure VPC architecture spanning multiple availability zones, with public and private subnets, NAT gateway, Bastion host, Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Group of web servers, and a MongoDB database in the private subnet.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Included

- **VPC**
  - 2 Availability Zones
  - Public + private subnets
  - Internet Gateway + NAT Gateway
  - Separate public and private route tables

- **Compute**
  - Bastion host in public subnet (for SSH access into private subnet)
  - Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instances
    - Bootstrapped with Nginx
    - Pulls frontend + API from GitHub repos
  - MongoDB EC2 instance in private subnet

- **Load Balancing**
  - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  - 2 Target Groups:
    - Port 80 ‚Üí frontend
    - Port 8080 ‚Üí API

- **Security**
  - Security Groups for Bastion, ALB, Web, and MongoDB
  - Private instances only accessible via Bastion host
